# Install Nextcloud (Latest) + Database (MariaDB/PostgreSQL/SQLite) + Encryption (Let's Encrypt Certificate/Self-signed) + Extra options on Docker

100% Handsfree & Ready to login.

Right now this will run on Ubuntu 16/18, Debian 9, CentOS 7. Maybe on Redhat 7.

The playbook runs on x86_64 and ARM(64) servers. It's tested on AWS EC2, Scaleway Server and on Rasberry 3+ running Debian 9.

Collabora and Talk work only on a x86_64 server. OnlyOffice is not yet available.

## Preparation

Clone this repo and change into the directory nextcloud_on_docker.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ReinerNippes/nextcloud_on_docker

cd nextcloud_on_docker
```

Install [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) and some needed tools by running the following command with a user that can sudo or is root. 
```bash
./prepare_system.sh
```

Note that root must have also sudo right otherwise the script will complain. Some hoster use distros where is is not in the sudoers file. In this case you have to add `root ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL` to /etc/sudoers.

## Configuration

Now you can configure the whole thing by editing the file `inventory` and some other files.

### Preliminary variables

First of all you must define the server fqdn. If you want to get a Let's Encrypt certificate this must be a valid DNS record pointing to your server. Port 80+443 must be open to the internet. 

If you have a private server or if you use an AWS domain name like `ec2-52-3-229-194.compute-1.amazonaws.com`, you'll end up with a self-signed certificate. This is fine but annoying, because you have to accept this certificate manually in your browser. If you don't have a fqdn use the server IP address.

*Important:* You will only be able to access Nextcloud through this address. 
```ini
# The domain name for your Nextcloud instance. You'll get a Let's Encrypt certificate for this domain.
nextcloud_server_fqdn       = nextcloud.example.tld
```

Let's Encrypt wants your email address. Enter it here:
```ini
# Your email address (for Let's Encrypt).
ssl_cert_email              = nextcloud@example.tld
```

### Nextcloud variables

Define where you want to find your Nextcloud program, config, database and data files in the hosts filesystem.
```ini
# Choose a directory for your Nextcloud data.
nextcloud_base_dir          = /opt/nextcloud
```

Define your Nextcloud admin user.
```ini
# Choose a username and password for your Nextcloud admin user.
nextcloud_admin             = 'admin'
nextcloud_passwd            = ''              # If empty the playbook will generate a random password.
```

Now it's time to choose and configure your favorite database management system.
```ini
# You must choose one database management system.
# Choose between 'pgsql' (PostgreSQL), 'mysql' (MariaDB) and 'sqlite' (SQLite).
nextcloud_db_type           = ''

# Options for Mariadb and PostgreSQL.
nextcloud_db_host           = 'localhost'
nextcloud_db_name           = 'nextcloud'
nextcloud_db_user           = 'nextcloud'
nextcloud_db_passwd         = ''              # If empty the playbook will generate a random password (stored in {{ nextcloud_base_dir }}/secrets ).
nextcloud_db_prefix         = 'oc_'
```

### Optional variables

If you want to setup the Nextcloud mail system put your mail server config here.
```ini
# Setup the Nextcloud mail server.
nextcloud_configure_mail    = false
nextcloud_mail_from         = 
nextcloud_mail_smtpmode     = smtp
nextcloud_mail_smtpauthtype = LOGIN
nextcloud_mail_domain       =
nextcloud_mail_smtpname     =
nextcloud_mail_smtpsecure   = tls
nextcloud_mail_smtpauth     = 1
nextcloud_mail_smtphost     =
nextcloud_mail_smtpport     = 587
nextcloud_mail_smtpname     =
nextcloud_mail_smtppwd      =
```

Setup the [restic](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) backup tool.
```ini
# The restic backup tool will be installed when 'backup_folder' is not empty.
restic_repo                 = ''              # e.g. '/var/nc-backup' .
# Configure the crontab settings for restic.
backup_day                  = *
backup_hour                 = 4
backup_minute               = 0
```

This playbook even supports the integration with an online office suite! You can choose between [Collabora](https://www.collaboraoffice.com/) and [ONLYOFFICE](https://www.onlyoffice.com).
```ini
# Choose an online office suite to integrate with your Nextcloud. Your options are (without quotation marks): 'none', 'collabora' and 'onlyoffice'.
online_office               = none
# When using Collabora, you're able to install dictionaries alongside with it. Collabora's default is German (de).
# collabora_dictionaries    = 'en'            # Separate ISO 639-1 codes with a space.
```

You can also install the TURN server needed for [Nextcloud Talk](https://nextcloud.com/talk/).
```ini
# Set to true to install TURN server for Nextcloud Talk.
talk_install                = false
```

If you want to, you can get access to your database with [Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/). Adminer is a web frontend for your database (like phpMyAdmin).
```ini
# Set to true to enable access to your database with Adminer at https://nextcloud_server_fqdn/adminer .
adminer_enabled             = false           # The password will be stored in {{ nextcloud_base_dir }}/secrets .
```

You can install [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/), a webgui for Docker.
```ini
# Set to true to install Portainer webgui for Docker.
portainer_enabled           = false
portainer_passwd            = ''              # If empty the playbook will generate a random password.
```

If you want to, you can get access to your [Traefik](https://traefik.io/) dashboard.
```ini
# Uncomment 'traefik_api_user' to get access to your Traefik dashboard at https://nextcloud_server_fqdn/traefik .
# traefik_api_user          = traefik
```

If you want to use [rclone](https://rclone.org) to backup your data to a cloud storage provider, remove the variable `restic_repo` from `Ã¬nventory` and edit the file `group_var/all` instead.
```ini
restic_repo:     "rclone:backup-nextcloud:unique-s3-bucket-name/s3-folder-name"
rclone_remote: |
      [backup-nextcloud]
      type = s3
      provider = AWS
      env_auth = false
      access_key_id = AKIxxxxx
      secret_access_key = QMpoxxxx
      region = us-east-1
      acl = private
      server_side_encryption = AES256
      storage_class = STANDARD_IA
```

## Installation

Run the Ansible playbook.
```bash
./nextdocker.yml
```

Your Nextcloud access credentials will be displayed at the end of the run.

```json
ok: [localhost] => {
    "msg": [
        "Your Nextcloud at https://nextcloud.example.tld is ready.",
        "Login with user: admin and password: fTkLgvPYdmjfalP8XgMsEg7plnoPsTvp ",
        "Other secrets you'll find in the directory /opt/nextcloud/secrets "
    ]
}
....
ok: [localhost] => {
    "msg": [
        "Manage your container at https://nextcloud.example.tld/portainer/ .",
        "Login with user: admin and password: CqDy4SqAXC5kEU0hHGQ5IucdBegwaVXa "
    ]
}
....
ok: [localhost] => {
    "msg": [
        "restic backup is configured. Keep your credentials in a safe place.",
        "RESTIC_REPOSITORY='/var/nc-backup'",
        "RESTIC_PASSWORD='ILIOxgRbmrvmvsUhtI7VtOcIz6II10jq'"
    ]
}

```

If you want to get rid of the containers run the following command.
```bash
ansible-playbook nextdocker.yml -e state=absent
```

Your data won't be deleted. You have to do this manually by executing the following.
```bash
rm -rf {{ nextcloud_base_dir }}
```
